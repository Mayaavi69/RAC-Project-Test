FIFA 22-23 RAC Project - Group 6
Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of FIFA players using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. The analysis is based on a dataset of approximately 25,218 records and aims to identify player traits, successful players, and create interactive dashboards for inferring player and club characteristics.
Key Components

Data Analysis: Utilizes a dataset from Kaggle containing male football player data with 68 variables.
Dashboards:

Dashboard 1: Focuses on overall player statistics, top players visualization, and regression analysis.
Dashboard 2: Provides more in-depth player analysis, including attribute distributions, correlations, and a player value prediction model.


Machine Learning Models:

Unsupervised Learning: K-means clustering to identify player segments.
Supervised Learning: Decision tree to identify significant variables and predict player characteristics.



Key Findings

Identified 7 distinct player clusters: Established Stars, Rising Talents, Veteran Leaders, Mid-Career Players, International Prospects, Domestic Role Players, and Journeymen.
Top 5 significant variables: Age, League_name, Nationality_name, Wage_eur, and Club_name.
Developed interactive dashboards for comprehensive player and league analysis.

Tools and Technologies

Python libraries: Streamlit, Plotly, Pandas, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning: K-means clustering, Decision Trees
Data Visualization: Various chart types including radar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps

Managerial Insights
The report provides valuable insights for team management, player scouting, and strategic decision-making in professional football. It offers data-driven approaches to player valuation, team composition, and performance prediction.
